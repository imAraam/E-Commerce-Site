Overview of design process

  In this report I will go through website description, target audience, functionality and implenetation, elements of interactivity, page run-down 
	as well as justification for final layout and use of colour.
	
	This is a phones sales website with the sole purpose of selling top quality phones to it's customers. The target audience is anyone of age who is
	capable of taking care of and using a phone.<p>
	
	This is a user friendly static website designed to ease the user's experience of purchasing a mobile phone. It allows them to browse and select a phone
	of their choosing and purchase it with a few mouse clicks. This website was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript, all of it's navigable pages have the 
	same layout with a header on top that includes the name of the site and a logo, a sidebar aligned to the left that allows swift navigation to all the
	sites pages, a registration box aligned to the right that allows the users to sign in or sign up in order to save their order information, a footer at the 
	bottom of the page that states the owner and copyright infringements. The user is able to use the left sidebar to navigate to and from all pages on the
	website. Elements of interactivity include the registration form that allows the user to enter their email and password to sign up for an account. Another
	similar element of interactivity is the order form which allows the user to purchase a phone after filling out simple details such as their name, address and
	card details. Lastly, the most important element of interactivity is the navigable sidebar which allows the users to go from one page to another with a simple
	click.

	There are a total of 13 navigable pages on this website (some of which can only be viewed when logged in, and some which required admin login to view). The home page, the hot-deals slideshow page, the hot-deals specs page, the order form page and the
	report page. The home page consists of a number of available products including their images, and it also lists their product IDs as well as other details 
	about them. The hot deals slideshow page is an automatic slideshow of the current phones available at a discounted price. It is a slideshow that automatically
	moves to the next image after a set amount of time, viewing the image of one of the phones as well as some text to the side of the image to display the old and
	new price. The hot-deals specs page reads from an XML file using Javascript to display detailed information about each phone with a discounted price on the
	slideshow. The order form page allows the user who is interested in purchasing a form to fill out a few simple queries and enter their card details to successfully
	order a phone. Lastly, the report page which includes a report written in HTML.
	
	
	My final layout is designed as it is as it increases user intuition enabling their curiosity to explore the site further. The chosen colours are dark Blue for the
	background image with a Cyan-like light Blue colour ejecting from the sides of the background image's hexagons. The header, sidebars, and footer are in a light blue
	colour as it is a colour that blends well with dark Blue in addition to research showing that Blue is associated with feelings of trust, authority and reliability. The font colour of the text is the classic White as it blends in well with the dark Blue background and eases tension on 
	the eye while the user is reading the content. The chosen colour scheme is neither analogous, triadic, nor complementary but provide a sense of tranquility to the user.
	Which ensures their return to the website.
